# Welcome to Moose Counter!

This Shiny app is a graphical user interface built with
{moosecounter} R package. The app and the package
implements count models to aid in estimating Moose populations
and composition. Analyses are based on surveyed cells,
residuals, point predictions, and prediction undertainty
help analysts to adaptively survey sampling units.
As a result of adaptive sampling, models and estimates
become more accurate. This improvement enables
better management of moose populations.

If you need an example data, [here is one from Mayo](MayoMMU_QuerriedData.csv).

The development of the R package and the Shiny app was funded
by the Government of Yukon.
